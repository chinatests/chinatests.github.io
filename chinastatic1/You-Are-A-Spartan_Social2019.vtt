00:00:00.844 --> 00:00:02.230
(light piano music)

2
00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:04.873
<v Eli>A new year begins today.</v>

3
00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.670
<v Jeffrey>For some of you, it's your first day.</v>

4
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.710
<v Chelsie>For others, it's your last first day.</v>

5
00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.430
<v Brigit>But all of your days at Michigan State</v>

6
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:16.423
will shape you for years to come.

7
00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.560
<v Prabu>This campus is full of possibilities,</v>

8
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.033
promise, and people determined to make a difference.

9
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.360
<v Danny>So while you're here, try something new.</v>

10
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.700
<v Joan>Figure out what you like and what you don't.</v>

11
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.653
Then do what you love.

12
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.820
<v Sam>Make the most of campus traditions.</v>

13
00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.000
<v Susan>Work in the community, study abroad.</v>

14
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.363
<v Kirk>And join in with</v>

15
00:00:42.363 --> 00:00:45.247
75,000 Spartans to yell, "Go green."

16
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.950
<v Satish>Listen to each other.</v>

17
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.650
<v Cole>To the sounds of the Spartan marching band.</v>

18
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.930
<v Katie>The splash of the red cedar.</v>

19
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.210
<v Tasha>And to countless conversations</v>

20
00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.473
that tumble out of research labs and residence halls.

21
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.043
<v Don>There is greatness in the air here.</v>

22
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.303
Take it all in.

23
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:08.830
<v Tyler>These years will be some</v>

24
00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.350
of the most fun you'll ever have,

25
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.650
but they will challenge you.

26
00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.410
<v Stephen>Along the way, you might change your major.</v>

27
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.880
You may change your views.

28
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.650
<v Dorinda>But when you leave here,</v>

29
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.890
you will be ready to change the world.

30
00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.773
<v Tom>You are a Spartan, and Spartans will.</v>

31
00:01:32.014 --> 00:01:35.097
(light upbeat music)
